 VBA Challenge Submission Files

The dataset for this activity contains large amount of Stock Market data for various Stocks(Tickers) over three consecutive years 2018-2020. Each worksheet corresponds to data of the respective year.
The VBA scripting is done to analyze generated stock market data and find performance of Tickers for each year.


# Analysis

Each Ticker's performance is analyzed by using parameters such as :
1.  YearlyChange - Difference between opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
2.  Percentage Change 
3.  Total stock volume of the stock

Conditional formatting is done for YearlyChange and Percentage Change columns that highlights positive change in green and negative change in red respectively.

Additional Analysis is done to find the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume"

All the above analysis is done simultaneously for each Worksheet(Year).
